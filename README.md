# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players (in this case, you play with the PC), who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. You start first with O, and if you manage to get 3 x O, on the horizontal, vertical or diagonal, you win, otherwise, you lose. But beware, it's very hard to win, the PC is very good!  I wish you good luck!
